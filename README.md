# Echo chrome extension template

This is a simple template so that you can easily get started creating a chrome extension with Echo authentication.

This template contains basic logic to allow the user to sign in/out of echo when clicking on the extension icon. You can test this out by running

```
npm install
npm run build
```

and then loading it up in your chrome browser.
